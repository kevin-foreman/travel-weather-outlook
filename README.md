## General info
This is a simple web-based application to find weather of a searched city to determine the weather of the city a user might wish to visit. User is presented with a simple search function and can enter the destination city. Upon searching for the city, the user is presented with current day weather as well as weather for the next 5 days in a forecast. User is presented with temperature, wind, humidity, and the UV index values to plan accordingly. After searching for a city, that city is saved as a recent search so the user can easily search for that city again, should they need to.
